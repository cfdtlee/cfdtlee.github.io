### FIRST PIC  
Figures: two worker, a notice, a bench  
Moves: one stands by, the other nails

- A worker nails a note.
- A note reads "WET PAINT".
- A bench was painted.
- A worker nails a notice ~~reading~~ "WET PAINT"(同谓) on a newly-painted bench.  

Problem:  

- A painter? where are other workers? Figure should be "two painters"
- 当我们选择Figure的时候，是否缺省信息？a/an/the/quantity
- 名词的选择，精准度  
- 形容词慎用
- The painter(who is a painter你知我知大家知的painter) is nailing the notice on the...    
- 精准表现在符号的选择上

### SECOND PIC 
Figures: the notice, the bench, wind  
Moves: flies away, be blown away

- The notice is being blown away by wind (from bench).

### THIRD PIC
Figure: a business man, a copy of newspaper, a bench, a squirrel  
Moves: walk

- A business man walks towards the bench with a copy of newspaper in his hand.

### FOURTH PIC
Figures: the business man, the newspaper  
Moves: be reading, sitting, be read  

- The business man sits and reads the newspaper with his leg crossed.

Problem： 
嵌套是前一个动作导致后一个动作（必然逻辑关系）
伴随的两件事必然是同时发生


### FIFTH PIC
Figure: 

Example from Double：  

1. 2 workers nailed a notice "wet paint" on the painted bench.  
2. A blast of wind blew away the notice from the bench.  
3. A businessman walked towards the bench.  
4. The businessman sat on the bench and read newspaper.  
5. The businessman stood up and found his suit painted.  
6. The business man went to dry cleaners to dry clean his suit.  

### Coordinate Sentences(5.9)
有没有必要用并列句？(And, but, or, so)  
看并列句表达简单句的意思还是重新组织意思，如果一个并列句表达的意思无右于简单句，那没有必要选择，组合句需要表达Logic（前因后果）。通常不用在Main Point中，常用在Supporting Detail中 

Practice：

1. One of the two workers is holding a oil-paint can and the other is nailing a notice on the bench.(没有必要)
2. Wind blows and the notice flies away.  
3. ~~A business man walks towards the bench and the is still wet.~~
4. The business man does not notice that the bench is wet and he  sits and reads.

Example from Double：

1. Two workers painted a bench aside the path in the park and they left a notice "WET PAINTED" on it for warning.
2. A blast of wind blew away the notice from the bench and now the chair made no difference with other unpainted *ones*.
3. Here comes a business man and he walked directly towards the bench.
4. The business man candid not notice the bench wet painted and he sat on reading newspaper.
5. The business man stood up from the chair and he suddenly found that his suit was stained.
6. The business man took off his suit and ~~he~~ rushed into a dry cleaner nearby to clean his suit.

### Complex Sentences
丰满，
1. Two workers nailed a notice "WET PAINTED" int the bench which is newly painted by them.
2. The notice "WET PAINTED" which is just nailed by two workers was blew away by wind.
3. A business man come towards the bench which is newly painted without noticing that it is wet
4. Without noticing that the bench is wet, the business sat down and read.

Example from double:

1. After two workers painted the chair on the street, they left a notice "WET PAINTED" on it *for warning*.
2. However, a blast of wind blew away the notice on the bench, now the chair made no difference with other unpainted ones.
3. At the time a business comes, he directly walked toward the bench.
4. Because the business didn't notice that the painted bench still wet he sat on it and began to read newspaper.
5. When the business man stood up and wad going to leave, he suddenly found that his suit was stained.
6. He took off his suit because he had to go to a dry cleaner nearby.

If simple sentence is comic, then the complex sentences is movie which is more smooth.
